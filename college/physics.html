        <h2>Computer Science Course</h2>
        <p>Description: Physics is the study of nature and its fundamental laws governing the universe. The course covers classical mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and relativity theory. Students learn to analyze physical phenomena, conduct experiments, and apply mathematical models to understand the behavior of matter and energy. From explaining the motion of celestial bodies to elucidating the behavior of subatomic particles, physics provides insights into the mysteries of the cosmos and drives technological advancements in various fields, including engineering, medicine, and renewable energy. Through hands-on experiments and theoretical inquiry, students develop problem-solving skills, scientific literacy, and a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the natural world.</p>
